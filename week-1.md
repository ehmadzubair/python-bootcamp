## Week 1 Notes

### Strings
- String variables are defined using two `"`s around the text

### Variables
A variable is a representation which can contain data of ANY type in Python.

### Variable Assignment
Example:
```
my_name = "Ehmad Zubair"
```

### String manipulation
Two strings can be added using a `+` sign.

Example:
```
my_full_name = "Ehmad Zubair " + "Chughtai"
```

### Numbers manipulation
Numbers are of two types:
- int
- float

Numbers are manipulated using very basic characters `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`

Example:
```
addition_result = 5 + 9
subtraction_result = 12 - 3
```

### Data Types
- String
- Number

Help: If you don't know the type of a variable, use `type(variable_name)` to see what type it is.

### Conditional Operators
- is equal to `==`
- is greater than `>`
- is greater than or equal to `>=`
